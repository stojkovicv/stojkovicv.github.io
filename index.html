          <li data-header="WireGuard Credentials Generator" data-paragraph="At the end of bachelor studies, my team developed engine to generate credentials for establishing the Wireguard tunnel to the faculty's network.
          We used Oracle APEX for database & deployment, along with PL/SQL for all operations. Main focus was on system design, data modeling and features development. I became very familiar with Wireguard VPN." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/WireGuard-credentials-engine" >WireGuard Credentials Generator</li>

          <li data-header="Streaming Analytics" data-paragraph="Proof of concept that streaming quality must be properly monitored. We established proxy between CDN and Nginx JavaScript implementation. All the metrics
          during video streaming are catched with CMCD (Common Media Client Data) and CMSD, stored in MySQL database and visualized with the Grafana in real time. I provided load testing of our
          service, using Python Locust. Project is fully dockerized and can be activated out-of-the-box." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/Streaming-Analytics-CMCD-CMSD" >Streaming Analytics</li>

          That comprises expansion of Reference Tools (RT) written in C and Python, with metrics related endpoints.
          Me and my university colleagues developed additional, student-side project for RT Application Provider. It's Flask & JS User Interface to manage existing CLI application." data-github="https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/repositories" >5G Media Streaming</li>
