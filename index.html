          <li data-header="WireGuard Credentials Generator" data-paragraph="At the end of bachelor studies, my team developed engine to generate credentials for establishing the Wireguard tunnel to the faculty's network.
          We used Oracle APEX for database & deployment, along with PL/SQL for all operations. Main focus was on system design, data modeling and features development. I became very familiar with Wireguard VPN." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/WireGuard-credentials-engine" >WireGuard Credentials Generator</li>
          <li data-header="Web Store API" data-paragraph="Self-driven side project, in which I developed fully functioning backend API for the web store. It took me 2 months to
          complete it, and it's totally reusable. Takeovers: Express framework, CRUD operations, password hashing, tokens authetication & threats security." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/webstore-backend-api">Web Store API</li>
          <li data-header="Reccomendation System" data-paragraph="Large project at the start of master studies, where we desgined and building the Wine reccomandation system based on collaborative filtering.
          I took care of data scraping module with Selenium, data matching with RapidFuzz and API development with Python Django.
          User Interface was completed with React and the project was one of the most successfull for that year." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/wine-recommendation-system" >Reccomendation System</li>
          <li data-header="Streaming Analytics" data-paragraph="Proof of concept that streaming quality must be properly monitored. We established proxy between CDN and Nginx JavaScript implementation. All the metrics
          during video streaming are catched with CMCD (Common Media Client Data) and CMSD, stored in MySQL database and visualized with Grafana in the real time. I provided load testing of our
          service, using Python Locust. Project is fully dockerized and can be activated out-of-the-box." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/Streaming-Analytics-CMCD-CMSD" >Streaming Analytics</li>
          <li data-header="Microservices Federation" data-paragraph="Univeristy project, not such a great team work and unpleasant experience. Idea was to create 
          protocol based on distributed system principles for online shops. Main takovers: Microservices architecture, Kubernetes, Observability of large applications, and the
          reminder that the wisest people are always very quiet." data-github="https://github.com/ADSP-Project" >Microservices Federation</li>
          <li data-header="Discord Crypto Bot" data-paragraph="Self driven, side project to create lovely little bot, meant to quickly provide crypto currency prices and plenty of other features like
          alert mechanism, past price visualization etc. Developed in JavaScript, I utilized several Design Patterns for error hadling and wrote the unit test. Check it out, it's cool stuff!" data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/crypto-tracker" >Discord Crypto Bot</li>
          <li data-header="5G Media Streaming" data-paragraph="Fraunhofer, BBC, Dolby, Qualcom, Kodak and of course 5GMAG are some of the 
          parties that are taking part in this project. Working model is such that technical specifications are created by 3GPP and implemented accordingly. My contribution is to enable and provide metrics reporting procedures during streaming
          within 5G network. That generally comprises expanding Reference Tools (RT) written in C and Python, with metrics related endpoints.
          Me and university colleagues completed additional, student-side project for RT Application Provider. We built Flask server and JS User Interface to manage existing CLI application." data-github="https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/repositories" >5G Media Streaming</li>
