          quite early, when I won <b>state award</b> at computer science competition. I am studying <b>MSc. Information systems</b> at Technical University of

          <li data-header="WireGuard Credentials Generator" data-paragraph="At the end of bachelor studies, my team developed engine to generate credentials for establishing Wireguard tunnel to the faculty's network.
          We used Oracle APEX for the database & deployment, along with PL/SQL for all functionalities. Main focus was on system design, data modeling and features development. I became very familiar with the Wireguard protocol. Codebase was completely stored and deployed in Oracle environment." >WireGuard Credentials Generator</li>
          <li data-header="Web Store API" data-paragraph="Self-driven side project, where I developed fully functioning backend API for the web store. It is indeed totally reusable.
            Takeovers: Express framework, CRUD operations, password hashing, tokens authetication & threats security." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/webstore-backend-api">Web Store API</li>
          <li data-header="Reccomendation System" data-paragraph="Large project at the beginning of master studies, where my team desgined and built wine reccomandation system based on collaborative filtering technique.
          I took care of data scraping module with Selenium, data matching with RapidFuzz and API development with Django.
          User Interface was completed with React and the project was one of the most successful for that year." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/wine-recommendation-system" >Reccomendation System</li>
          <li data-header="CRM System Maintenance" data-paragraph="I worked as a full-stack engineer in a small company in M√ºnster, where I strengthened object oriented programming, working with large system for production. I was programming in C#, React within the Azure cloud to maintain & enhance the system, fix bugs etc. As a student, this was an utterly good opportunity to be a member of the SCRUM development team. The system wasn't open source.">CRM System Maintenance</li>
          <li data-header="Streaming Analytics" data-paragraph="Proof of concept that streaming quality must be properly monitored. We established proxy between CDN and Nginx JavaScript implementation. All the metrics
          during video streaming are catched with CMCD (Common Media Client Data) and CMSD, stored in MySQL database and visualized with the Grafana in real time. I provided load testing of our
          service, using Python Locust. Project is fully dockerized and it's available out-of-the-box." data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/Streaming-Analytics-CMCD-CMSD" >Streaming Analytics</li>
          <li data-header="Microservices Federation" data-paragraph="Univeristy project, not such a great team experience. Idea was to establish the
          protocol based on distributed systems principles for online shops. Main takovers: Microservices architecture, Kubernetes, Observability of large applications, and the
          reminder that the wisest people are always very quiet." data-github="https://github.com/ADSP-Project" >Microservices Federation</li>
          <li data-header="Discord Crypto Bot" data-paragraph="Self driven, side project to create lovely little bot, meant to quickly provide crypto currency prices and plenty of other features like
          alert mechanism, past price visualization etc. Developed in JavaScript, I utilized several design patterns for error hadling and wrote the unit test. Check it out, it's cool stuff!" data-github="https://github.com/stojkovicv/crypto-tracker" >Discord Crypto Bot</li>
          <li data-header="5GMS Reference Tools" data-paragraph="This project is implementation of 3GPP specifications for 5G Media Streaming architecture.
            Under 5GMAG Public License and together with BBC team, I am contributing to 5G Core reference component ¬ªApplication Function¬´ with Metrics Reporting APIs. I am developing full-stack ¬ªApplication Provider¬´ module, utilizing entire scope of standarized provisioning operations.
            I write C APIs, maintain Python Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, glittering JavaScript for GUI and automated integration tests.
            As a student developer of Fraunhofer Fokus, this work will be the scope of my master thesis." data-github="https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/repositories" >5GMS Reference Tools</li>
